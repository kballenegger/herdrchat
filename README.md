Your agents keep running on your computer. HerdrChat turns their
[herdr](https://herdr.dev) workspaces into readable conversations on your iPhone or iPad,
connected directly over SSH. No HerdrChat account. No relay server.

## Less terminal. More conversation.

- **Pick up where you left off.** Read Claude Code, Codex and OMP history, including replies started at your desk.
- **See what needs you.** Search chats grouped by Needs you, Working and Idle. On iPad, keep the list beside your conversation.
- **Keep things readable.** Message bubbles, code blocks, tables and compact tool activity.
- **Give an agent a nudge.** Send a follow-up or tap a supported approval choice.
- **Show it, don't describe it.** Add a screenshot or photo to a message; it goes to your machine over SSH and the agent opens it there.
- **Type like on a Mac.** With an iPad keyboard, Return sends, Shift-Return starts a new line, Command-Return sends either way, and Command-V attaches a copied picture. Settings > Conversations > Return sends turns Return back into a new line.
- **Keep your machine yours.** Connect over SSH, usually through Tailscale. Credentials stay in the iOS Keychain; host keys are pinned.

## Try it

Just curious? Open the built-in **Demo** host. No server setup needed.

For your own agents:

1. Install HerdrChat from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/herdrchat/id6791874615) (free), or [build it locally](docs/getting-started.md#build-the-ios-app).
2. Set up herdr and the [Claude, Codex or OMP integration](docs/getting-started.md#prepare-your-computer) on your computer.
3. Add that computer in **Hosts** (in the **…** menu on Chats), test the SSH connection, and open a chat.

**On the App Store** for iPhone and iPad, iOS 17+. Android is experimental.
Push notifications need extra setup on your host. See
[setup and limitations](docs/getting-started.md).

## Theming

Each host can restyle the app with a file of its own, `~/.herdrchat/theme.json`,
so the easiest way to change how HerdrChat looks is to ask an agent on that
machine. **Settings → Appearance → Copy prompt for an agent** puts the request
on your clipboard; paste it into a chat and add what you would like ("warmer",
"green, like my terminal"). The phone picks the change up the next time the
chat list is on screen (it checks about every 10 seconds there), or at once
from **Reload theme**, and the theme follows whichever host is selected. See
[the file's shape](docs/getting-started.md#theming).

## Want to tinker?

Expo + React Native + TypeScript, with a native SSH module. The agents run on
your computer, not on the phone.
