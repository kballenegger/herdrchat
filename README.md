Your agents keep running on your computer. HerdrChat turns their
[herdr](https://herdr.dev) workspaces into readable conversations on your iPhone or iPad,
connected directly over SSH. No HerdrChat account. No relay server.

## Less terminal. More conversation.

- **Pick up where you left off.** Read Claude Code, Codex and OMP history, including replies started at your desk.
- **See what needs you.** Search chats grouped by Needs you, Working and Idle. On iPad, keep the list beside your conversation.
- **Keep things readable.** Message bubbles, code blocks, tables and compact tool activity.
- **Watch the agents it hands work to.** When Claude Code starts a subagent or a workflow, it shows in the chat as a card that says what it was asked and where it stands, then what it handed back. Open a subagent to read its own conversation as it works, or a workflow to see each phase and each agent in it.
- **Give an agent a nudge.** Send a follow-up or tap a supported approval choice.
- **Every slash command, as the terminal has them.** Type `/` for the commands the agent on that machine actually has: Claude Code's built-ins for the version installed there, your own commands and skills, the project's, and your plugins', each with what it does and what it takes. Codex chats get Codex's own menu. A command that takes nothing runs when you tap it; one that takes something fills in and shows what goes after it. The list is read from the machine in the background, every ten minutes at most, and kept on the phone.
- **Show it, don't describe it.** Add a screenshot or photo to a message; it goes to your machine over SSH and the agent opens it there.
- **Type like on a Mac.** With an iPad keyboard, Return sends, Shift-Return starts a new line, Command-Return sends either way, and Command-V attaches a copied picture. Settings > Conversations > Return sends turns Return back into a new line.
- **Keep your machine yours.** Connect over SSH, usually through Tailscale. Credentials stay in the iOS Keychain; host keys are pinned.

## Try it

Just curious? Open the built-in **Demo** host. No server setup needed.

For your own agents:

1. Install HerdrChat from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/herdrchat/id6791874615) (free), or [build it locally](docs/getting-started.md#build-the-ios-app).
2. Set up herdr and the [Claude, Codex or OMP integration](docs/getting-started.md#prepare-your-computer) on your computer.
3. Add that computer in **Hosts** (in the **…** menu on Chats), test the SSH connection, and open a chat.

**On the App Store** for iPhone and iPad, iOS 17+. Android is experimental.
Push notifications need extra setup on your host. See
[setup and limitations](docs/getting-started.md).

## Machines

If herdr on your host has other computers saved as machines
(`herdr machine add <ssh-target>`), their chats show up in that host's chat
list too, each row starting with the machine's name. There is nothing to set
up on the phone: the app reaches each machine through the host, with the
host's own `ssh` and its `~/.ssh/config`, so the machine never has to be
reachable from the phone. Opening, following and sending work as they do for
the host's own chats. Disabled machines are left out. Push notifications
cover only the host's own chats for now, and a machine uses its host's theme.

The host's `ssh` runs without a terminal (`BatchMode=yes`), inside the SSH
session the app opened, so it has to reach the machine on its own: with a key
file that the host's `~/.ssh/config` names for the machine (`IdentityFile`),
not an agent that asks for approval on the host's screen or one only its
desktop login has, and with the machine already in the host's
`~/.ssh/known_hosts`. An interactive `ssh klaw` on the host can pass where this
fails, so check it from another computer:
`ssh <host> 'ssh -o BatchMode=yes klaw true'`. If that fails, add the key to the
host's config, or run `ssh klaw` once on the host to accept its host key. The
list says which of the two it is under the chats. herdr must also be where a
non-interactive SSH session on the machine looks (`~/.local/bin`, `~/bin`,
`/opt/homebrew/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`); one in `~/.cargo/bin` needs a link
into `~/.local/bin`.

## Terminal

Every herdr pane has a terminal, not only the ones running an agent you can
chat with. A pane with a shell, a build, `vim` or `htop` in it is listed under
its workspace as a **Terminal** row, with the program herdr reports and its
folder; an agent's chat opens its own pane from **Terminal** in its header,
for whatever the chat cannot show (a panel, a login prompt, a full-screen
tool). It is a real emulator ([SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm)):
colours, cursor, mouse, selection, a swipe that scrolls back through the
pane's history (herdr's own), pinch to change the size, a
hardware keyboard with Ctrl and Option, and a bar over the software keyboard
with Esc, Tab, sticky Ctrl and Alt, the arrows, Home and End, and Paste. It
runs on the host's SSH connection: an agent pane through `herdr agent attach`,
a shell pane through `herdr session attach` with the pane zoomed to fill the
screen. That zoom is herdr's own, so a desktop attached to the same session
zooms too while the phone has the pane open; leaving the terminal puts the
zoom and herdr's focus back (not if the app is killed while attached: then
unzoom it on the desktop). Leaving also hangs up: nothing keeps running.
iPhone and iPad only for now.

## Theming

Each host can restyle the app with a file of its own, `~/.herdrchat/theme.json`,
so the easiest way to change how HerdrChat looks is to ask an agent on that
machine. **Settings → Appearance → Copy prompt for an agent** puts the request
on your clipboard; paste it into a chat and add what you would like ("warmer",
"green, like my terminal"). The phone picks the change up the next time the
chat list is on screen (it checks about every 10 seconds there), or at once
from **Reload theme**, and the theme follows whichever host is selected. See
[the file's shape](docs/getting-started.md#theming).

## Want to tinker?

Expo + React Native + TypeScript, with a native SSH module. The agents run on
your computer, not on the phone.
