 * The herdr version the selected host last reported.
 *
 * Same shape as the attention count (`badge.ts`), for the same reason: the chat list already pulls
 * a snapshot every few seconds and the version rides along in it, so publishing
 * what is already in hand costs nothing. Settings polling for it separately
 * would be a second SSH round-trip to learn something the screen behind it knew.
 *
 * Null means "no snapshot has landed yet", which is a different thing from a
 * host that answered without a version field — `versionVerdict` distinguishes
 * the two once a value arrives.
