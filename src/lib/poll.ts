/**
 * When a poll loop should be running, and how fast.
 *
 * Two hooks poll this app's host — the chat list and the open thread — and both
 * used to run flat out, forever, regardless of anything. Three problems, all of
 * which cost battery and cellular data on a device that has neither to spare:
 *
 * The app kept polling while backgrounded. iOS suspends the timers anyway, but
 * the socket usually dies with them, so the first poll after a resume ran
 * against a dead connection.
 *
 * Both screens polled at once. Expo Router's native stack keeps a screen mounted
 * underneath a pushed one, and effect cleanup only runs on unmount — so opening
 * a conversation did not stop the list behind it.
 *
 * And nothing backed off. A host that was down got a failing SSH round-trip
 * every two seconds, indefinitely.
 *
 * This is pure arithmetic and a state machine, kept out of React so it can be
 * tested without one.

 * connections left open it refused the phone outright during the simulator
 * acceptance pass. A loop that hits one pauses until the user pulls to refresh
 * or edits the host, which replaces the client and so restarts the loop.
