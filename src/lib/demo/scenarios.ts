 * one failure, the folder-trust question a first start asks, a reply with a
 * table, an agent restyling the app through the host's theme file, a machine
 * the host can no longer reach. The UI tests drive the Demo with the phrases below, and anyone
 * trying the Demo can type them too. Screens copy captures from Claude Code
 * 2.1.285 (see src/lib/__tests__/fixtures/screens), so the real parsers read
 * them without a special case.
