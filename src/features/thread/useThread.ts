   * first requires an observed state change within 5000ms; otherwise it returns
   * agent_prompt_stalled." That named error is exactly the stuck-in-the-composer
   * case the blind Enter was written to guess at, observed by the process that
   * owns the terminal, rather than inferred here from a fixed sleep.
   *
   * So on a modern host there are two outcomes and neither needs us to guess:
   * `delivered` returns immediately, `stalled` fails the bubble honestly.
   *
   * `unverified` is the legacy path, for hosts with no `agent prompt` (and the
   * fork's `written_to_pty`). There `pane run` only means keystrokes were sent,
   * so the old dance survives, including the second Enter, which is unsafe in
   * principle (if the first send DID land it submits an empty line into a live
   * agent) but is also the only thing that recovers a stuck composer on a host
   * with no alternative. It is narrowed to the one case it is for: the agent
   * still sitting idle. An agent that went `blocked` read the prompt and opened
   * a menu, and Enter there picks the highlighted option, usually "Yes", which
   * approved a tool call nobody saw (#76). So the wait accepts `blocked` as a
   * reaction, and the status is read again right before any Enter.
   *
   * `wasWorking` still guards all of it, and herdr's own caveat is why: --wait
   * "does not track turns: if the agent is already working, that active turn's
   * completion may match." Sending into a busy agent just queues, so there is
   * nothing to wait for and waiting would match the wrong turn.
