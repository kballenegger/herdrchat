 * ORDER MATTERS, and it is the reverse of the intuitive one.
 *
 * Secrets go first, then the database row that points at them. The other way
 * round, a keychain delete that fails after the row is gone leaves a secret
 * nothing references and nothing can ever reach again — invisible, undeletable,
 * and still on the device. Doing it in this order means a failure leaves a host
 * whose key is missing, which is a state the app can already describe: the next
 * connection attempt says the key is gone, and removing the host retries the
 * whole thing.
 *
 * Best-effort per host rather than all-or-nothing. One keychain entry refusing
 * to delete must not strand the other four hosts' data on the device, so each is
 * attempted and the failures are collected and reported.
