/**
 * A chat row with swipe actions: Pin and Mute on the leading side, Rename and

 *
 * `ChatRow` stays presentational — it does not know it can be swiped, which is
 * what lets it keep being used wherever a row is drawn without one.
 *
 * The leading side is safe here because the chats list is the app's root (and the
 * iPad sidebar) with no back gesture to fight: a leading action would begin in
 * the left-edge strip an interactive pop owns. Reusing this row on a pushed
 * screen means dropping `onTogglePin` and `onToggleMute`, which removes them.
 *
 * Two actions a side, not more. Past three the panel is wider than the row's
 * text and the swipe stops being a shortcut.

   * shifts every row below it up by one, which recycles them all, and with
   * `close()` that showed as a blank gap where a row should be: the row's height
   * was reserved while its content was still animating in from off-screen.
   *
   * The state value is unused; `onReset` firing on a workspace-id change is the
   * whole point, and it is the hook FlashList ships for exactly this.
