/**
 * An empty state: an icon, one line of explanation, one clear action.
 *
 * Deliberately not a shrug — every empty state in this app is a place where the
 * user can do something, so the action is required rather than optional wherever
 * one exists.
 *
 * A SCROLL VIEW, which looks like overkill for four elements and is not. This
 * was a centred `flex: 1` box, and at the largest accessibility text size its
 * content was taller than the screen — so the icon overlapped the header, the
 * title ran off the right edge, and the button this component exists to offer
 * was below the fold with no way to reach it. An empty state whose only action
 * is unreachable is worse than an empty screen.
 *
 * `flexGrow: 1` with `justifyContent: 'center'` is the pattern that gets both:
 * centred while it fits, scrollable the moment it does not.
