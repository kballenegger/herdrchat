            THE ONE PLACE `allowFontScaling` IS OFF, and it is not an oversight.
            This glyph is sized from the avatar's own diameter, not from the type
            scale — it is a picture drawn with a font, the way an icon is. Left
            scaling, the emoji grew with the reader's text setting while the
            circle around it stayed 52pt, and at the accessibility sizes it
            simply overflowed its own avatar. Nothing here is text to be read:
            the row's accessibility label carries the meaning, which is why this
            is hidden from the accessibility tree two lines up. */}
