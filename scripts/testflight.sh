# Archive → export → upload the Expo app to TestFlight, using an App Store
# Connect API key (no interactive Apple ID / 2FA needed).
#
# The predecessor of this script, which shipped the SwiftUI app, is
# scripts/legacy-testflight.sh. Both target the SAME bundle id, so whichever
# ships last is what testers get.
#
# Prereqs (already true on this machine):
#   - Full Xcode, ASC API key at ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/AuthKey_<KEYID>.p8
#   - An App Store Connect app record for the bundle id in app.json
#
# Usage:
#   APPLE_TEAM_ID=<team> ASC_KEY_ID=<key> ASC_ISSUER_ID=<uuid> scripts/testflight.sh
#   ... scripts/testflight.sh --no-upload   # stop at the .ipa
#
# From a background session (SSH, launchd), where the login keychain cannot be
# unlocked and codesign fails with errSecInternalComponent, sign from a keychain
# whose password is on disk instead:
#   SIGNING_KEYCHAIN=~/Library/Keychains/x.keychain-db SIGNING_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD_FILE=~/.x/.kcpass \
#   ASC_SIGNING_CERT=<sha1 of a distribution cert in it> ASC_PROFILE_NAME=<App Store profile holding it> \
#   ... scripts/testflight.sh
# The archive is then signed for distribution directly (manual signing on the
# app target only), since no development identity lives in that keychain.
#
# See RELEASING.md.
#
# NOTE: TestFlight rate-limits uploads per app per day (altool 90382). Bump the
# build number on every change so commits stay honest, but batch the uploads.
