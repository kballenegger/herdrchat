/// Offers Command-Return, and Shift-Return when asked, while anything inside
/// it has keyboard focus.
///
/// UIKit collects `keyCommands` from every responder between the first
/// responder and the window, and a view's next responder is its superview. So
/// with the composer's text view focused, this container is on that path and
/// its commands are live, without swizzling the text view or touching the app
/// delegate. Command-Return also shows in the list iPadOS draws while Command
/// is held.
///
/// Shift-Return exists because React Native cannot tell it from Return. With
/// `submitBehavior="submit"`, RN's `textView(_:shouldChangeTextIn:replacementText:)`
/// sees "\n" for both, fires `onSubmitEditing` and refuses the insertion. So the
/// command takes Shift-Return before the text view does and only reports it;
/// the newline is spliced into the draft in JS (`insertNewline`). Inserting it
/// here would go through that same delegate and be swallowed as a submit.
///
/// Command-V exists because a plain text view pastes nothing when the
/// pasteboard holds only a picture. A command on this container is found
/// before the system's own Paste key equivalent, so it is offered only while
/// the pasteboard is a lone picture (`pasteAction` in `src/lib/composerKeys.ts`
/// is the same rule, and the one that is tested). With text on it, Command-V
/// never reaches this view and stays the system's own paste, prompt rules and
/// all. If the pasteboard changes between UIKit asking for `keyCommands` and
/// the key landing, the action hands anything but a lone picture to the first
/// responder's `paste(_:)`, which is the text view's — RN's override of it
/// marks the text as pasted, so a multi-line paste is not taken for a Return
/// that sends.
///
/// Checking the pasteboard here reads only its types (`hasImages`,
/// `hasStrings`), which raises no paste prompt. Attaching the picture does
/// not: JS reads it with expo-clipboard's `getImageAsync`, a programmatic read,
/// so iOS shows "Allow Paste" unless Settings > HerdrChat > Paste from Other
/// Apps is Allow — the same prompt the attach menu's "Paste Picture" raises.
